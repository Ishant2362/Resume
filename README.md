# ğŸ“„ Personal Resume Website

I created a personal resume portfolio website to make my CV easily accessible and always up to date.
The site includes:

ğŸ“‘ Online resume view & download options

ğŸ”— Direct links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles

ğŸ“§ A quick way to contact me


This project reflects my interest in web development basics along with my focus on data analytics and SQL expertise. It also makes networking easier by keeping my resume shareable through a single link.
